## Victor Stanton - Interactive Workout Planner

A dynamic, interactive web app that generates customizable workout tables. The app allows users to set the number of weeks and sets, then interact with the workout table by clicking cells to track repetitions. Includes drop-down menus for selecting body parts and exercises, as well as an "Add Exercise" feature that will eventually allow users to add multiple exercises. The design features a responsive styled layout with gradient backgrounds and clickable elements.
